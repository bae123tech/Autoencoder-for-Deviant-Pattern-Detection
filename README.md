### Anomaly Detection with Autoencoders: A Technical Overview

**Introduction**  
Anomaly detection is a machine learning approach aimed at identifying patterns in data that significantly deviate from normal behavior. These unusual patterns, termed as anomalies or outliers, often signify errors, fraudulent activities, or rare occurrences requiring further investigation. Anomaly detection techniques are widely used across multiple industries, including finance, cybersecurity, healthcare, and predictive maintenance. A variety of methods exist for detecting anomalies, such as statistical techniques, clustering-based algorithms, and advanced deep learning models.

Some common anomaly detection techniques include Principal Component Analysis (PCA), K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Isolation Forests, and ensemble approaches. In the realm of deep learning, Autoencoders have emerged as a popular model for this task. Autoencoders are specialized neural networks that learn how to compress and then reconstruct data. Trained exclusively on normal data, they later detect anomalies by measuring the error between the reconstructed and original data. This reconstruction error serves as an indicator of whether the new data follows the patterns learned during training. Evaluating anomaly detection models poses challenges, as anomalies are rare and typically underrepresented. Key metrics such as precision, recall, F1-score, and cross-validation techniques help in assessing the performance of these models.

**Why Not PCA?**  
Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is a widely used technique for dimensionality reduction, converting high-dimensional data into a lower-dimensional space while retaining the majority of its variance. PCA identifies key components (or principal components) that represent the directions of highest variance in the data, with each component being orthogonal to the others.

While PCA can be used for anomaly detection, it has certain limitations. The method assumes that the data's underlying structure is linear and that principal components capture the most relevant features. However, when dealing with complex, highly nonlinear datasets, PCA may fail to capture essential relationships, making it less suitable for such scenarios. Additionally, in cases where anomalies are rare and normal data dominates, PCA might fail to effectively highlight anomalies.

**Autoencoders: A Superior Approach**  
Autoencoders are unsupervised neural networks designed for tasks like dimensionality reduction, data compression, and reconstruction. The primary objective of an autoencoder is to learn a compact representation of input data by encoding it into a lower-dimensional latent space and then decoding it to recover the original data.

An autoencoder typically consists of three main components:

1. **Encoder**: Maps the input data to a lower-dimensional latent space (compressed representation).
2. **Code/Latent Space**: Stores the compressed version of the input.
3. **Decoder**: Reconstructs the original input from the compressed representation.

During training, the autoencoder is optimized to minimize the difference between the input and the reconstructed output, allowing it to learn complex and nonlinear dependencies within the data. This capability makes autoencoders suitable for tasks such as image compression, anomaly detection, and synthetic data generation.

For anomaly detection, the autoencoder is trained on data that represents normal behavior, learning typical patterns and relationships. When new data is processed, the reconstruction error—i.e., the difference between the original input and its reconstructed version—is computed. If this error exceeds a predefined threshold, the data is considered an anomaly. This unsupervised approach enables autoencoders to detect anomalies without requiring explicit labels in the training data.

**Project Overview**  
In this project, the following steps were undertaken:

1. Conducted **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** on a retail transaction dataset to gain insights into data distributions and patterns.
2. Developed and trained an **Autoencoder model** for anomaly detection.
3. Evaluated the model using standard classification metrics such as **precision**, **recall**, and **F1-score**, specifically focusing on identifying fraudulent transactions.
